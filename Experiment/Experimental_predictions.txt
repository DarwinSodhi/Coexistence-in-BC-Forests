Experimental Predictions 

1. Tree species will have more biomass/growth rates in conspecific soil versus heterospecific soil because of pathogenic fungi
2. Tree species will have worse/lower growth rates in higher planted densities 
3. Tree species will have more biomass/growth rates in the lower temperature treatment as the temperature will be closer to the optimal for pathogenic fungi 
4. Removing soil pathogens---through sterilization---from soil will cause species performance (growth rate/biomass) to be similar 

Interactions between predictions 
1. Temperature treatment effects will only be seen if species is planted in conspecific soil as pathogens have to be present
2. High temperature will impact conspecific soil as the pathogens will be denatured 
3. Conspecific soil effects can be removed with high temperature or steralization 
4. Heterospecific soil will have no impact on species performance as no species specific pathogens will be present
5. High density treatment will always have a negative effect regardless of other treatments 
6. Sterilization will remove all other treatment effects other than density
7. Non-sterilization keeps all other treatment effects
