Cold stratification for interior spruce (Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development - Tree Seed Centre Internal Document): 

•	fully submerge seed in regular tap water for 24 hours in a plastic bag or vial;  
•	drain and surface dry at room temperature until free water has evaporated and seed moves freely;
•	place in a plastic bag allowing a small amount of air exchange;
•	place in the refrigerator for 21 days at 2-5 degrees C ;
•	monitor seed during cold stratification to ensure it doesn't dry out, rot or germinate early;
•	after this period is complete, the seed is ready to be sown.


Cold stratification for subalpine fir (Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development - Tree Seed Centre Internal Document):

•	To prepare Abies for sowing, we use a "cold strat procedure": 
•	fully submerge seed in regular tap water for 48 hours in a plastic bag or vial;  
•	drain of free water;  
•	place in a plastic bag allowing a small amount of air exchange;
•	provide a cold strat in the refrigerator for 56 days at 2-5 degrees C
•   monitor seed during cold stratification to ensure it doesn't dry out, rot or germinate early
•	after this period is complete, the seed is ready to be sown

Germinants Methods:

Once the seeds have been cold stratified, they will be placed in a flat with sterile potting mix and placed in a growth chamber for three weeks at 17.5 degrees C, 24hrs in the dark and 50% relative humidity. A three week germination period is based on standard seed testing trials (Li et al. 1994. Canadian Journal of Botany). Further both genuses---Abies and Picea---were shown to have a higher germination percentage in a dark treatment compared to a light treatment (Li et al. 1994. Canadian Journal of Botany). Since most seeds benefit from variable temperatures while germinating (see. Li et al. 1994. Canadian Journal of Botany and Hansen & Leiusson. 2008. Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research), we decided to germinate seeds in 20 degrees C and 15 degrees C for 12 hours each day, this was chosen as the average temperature between the two---17.5 degrees---represents the median value of both of our temperature treatments. 50% relative humidity was chosen as it refects the median value of similar studies (see. Grossnickle & Fan. 1999. Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research and Landhausser et al. 2001. Canadian Journal of Forest Research). Seeds will be watered until they are moist every three days (CFIA, methods and procedures for testing seed). After three weeks, I will put germinated seedlings into pots for experimental manipulation. Germination is defined for both species at the point the protruding radical is equal in size to seed coat (Anderson and Winteron, 1996, American Journal of Botany).

Soil Methods: 

I will sift soil collected from Alex Fraser---the sieve will have a minimum of 1-cm between rings---this is to get rid of any rocks or other unwanted materials from the soil (Packer & Clay. 2000. Letters to Nature). Large roots will be cut to ensure they fit through the sieve. After I have filtered the soil, I will return the soil to their respective buckets. A seperate sieve will be used for each respective species' soils. I will also sift the sterile potting mix. Once I have filtered all the soil, I will autoclave half of all the soil at 211 degrees Celsius for a minimum of 4 hours (Packer & Clay. 2000. Letters to Nature). This will give me my sterilized treatment. I will put equally weighed amounts of potting mix and soil collected from Alex Fraser together in each pot. Anytime soil is being handled, I will wear gloves to avoid cross-contamination.

Experimental methods: 

Once seeds have germinated and the soil is ready, I will weigh the seedlings for the initial biomass measurement. Once I have weighed the seedlings, I will put the seedlings into their pots for the rest of the experiment. This experiment has 16 treatments (see treatments above) in total, and I will label each pot using ducktape and a sharpie with the respective treatment, replicate number, and species. I will randomize the layout of the pots. I will separate each treatment based temperature; for example, I will set one out of the two growth chambers to 10 degrees C. In contrast, I will set the other growth chambers to 25 degrees C. A hobo logger will be placed inside both of the chambers to measure temperature data. The growth chamber will be set to a 12 hour day and 12 hour night photoperiod (Chiang et al. 2018. Forests and Webber et al. 2005. Tree Physiology). I will change the temperature of the growth chambers and move pots across chambers every four weeks to avoid chamber bias (Kueppers et al. 2017. Forests). Further, I will rotate pot position---every week---to account for any possible spatial differences within a growth chamber (Landhauser et al. 2001. Canadian Journal of Forest Research). I will water each pot every two days until moist (CFIA, methods and procedures for testing seed). I will take soil moisture readings weekly of a random subset of pots to determine if pots watering needs to be modified. At the end of the experiment, I will reweigh each seedling to find out the final biomass. I will also measure and record height of seedlings each week. Finally, I will measure the dried above and below ground biomass of seedlings once they have been put in a drying oven at 70 degrees C for 72 hours (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013. Australian Journal of Botany).
