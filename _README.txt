a) coexistencebc/notes/Jansen-Connell-Field-Methods

This is an overview of what was done on mount Harvey in 2020 and what needs to be done in 2021


b) coexistencebc/notes/Smither's waypoints.xlsx


This is a document that highlights the waypoints for all our plots in Smithers BC. Some waypoints refer to plots set up in 2019 but these need to be removed and are clearly labelled

All 2020 waypoints were also saved from the lab GPS
