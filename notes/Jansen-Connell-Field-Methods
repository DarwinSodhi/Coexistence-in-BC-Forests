Janzen-Connell Field Methods

We decided to only select forest sites that were dominated by coniferous trees as these sites were similar across a wide range of locations in Smithers. This allowed for easy comparison between and within sites as many sites shared similar species composition. 

To start setting up a plot we would first mark a single tree with flagging tape. Using the first tagged tree as a waypoint, we moved twenty meters in a cardinal direction in the oppposite direction of the hiking trail and tagged the nearest tree. We repeated this until we had a twenty by twenty meter plot with four tagged corners. A one meter PVC pipe was also put in 10 meters between each corner, this allowed us to ensure trees on the edge were also tagged.

After creating a twenty by twenty meter plot, we tagged and measured the diameter at breast height (1.37 meters) of all adult trees (any woody species with one stem and is larger than 1.37 meters) in the plot. Sometimes adult trees of the same species were grouped together, this occurred if trees were within two meters of each other and trees were mumbered in a clock wise direction with a tree tag, put on the first tree that was measured. To ensure each adult tree was tagged, we started from corner number 4 and moved diagonally to corner number 2. Insert picture of how trees were tagged. 

To measure germinants and seedlings within our plots, we set up a diagonal transect from one corner of our plot to another using a measuring tape. Every four meters on this transect, we counted, labelled and measured the height of every seedling within a 0.5 by 0.5 meter subplot. Each Diagonal transect had six germinant/seedling consensus subplots. For each subplot, a corner was tagged using a tree tag and a hair pin. To reduce measurement bias, we alternated which sides of the measuring tape the subplot was set up on. 

Each plot was atleast 50 meters away from each other and we set up all plots using an elevational gradient which was present on Mount Harvey in Smithers, BC.
