Cold stratification for interior spruce: 

•	fully submerge seed in regular tap water for 24 hours in a plastic bag or vial;  
•	drain and surface dry at room temperature until free water has evaporated and seed moves freely;
•	place in a plastic bag allowing a small amount of air exchange;
•	place in the refrigerator for 21 days at 2-5 degrees C ;
•	monitor seed during cold stratification to ensure it doesn't dry out;
•	after this period is complete, the seed is ready to be sown.


Cold stratification for subalpine fir:

•	To prepare Abies for sowing, we use a "cold strat procedure": 
•	 fully submerge seed in regular tap water for 48 hours in a plastic bag or vial;  
•	drain of free water;  
•	place in a plastic bag allowing a small amount of air exchange;
•	provide a cold strat in the refrigerator for 1 month at 2-5 degrees C at 45% moisture content;
•	after 30 days dryback the seed to 30 – 35 % moisture content (+/- 3%);
•	return the seed to cold strat for another 2 months;
•	after this period is complete, the seed is ready to be sown

Germinants Methods:

Once the seeds have been cold stratified, they will be placed in pots with sterile potting mix---filled halfway or 0.2373345 liters---and placed in a growth chamber for a week (specify what temperature/photoperiod). This is because we are not testing germination success but instead looking at species performance once fully germinated. After a week, I will put germinated seedlings into pots for experimental manipulation. Before I use the pots, I will disinfect with 98% alcohol for 30 seconds. 

Soil Methods: 

I will sift soil collected from Alex Fraser---the sift will have a minimum of 1-cm between rings---this is to get rid of any rocks or other unwanted materials from the soil. After I have filtered the soil, I will return the soil to their respective buckets.  I will also sift the sterile potting mix with the same sift---once the sift has been cleaned with alcohol to prevent cross-contamination. Once I have filtered all the soil, I will autoclave half of all the soil at 211 degrees Celsius. This will give me my sterilized treatment. I will use a graduated cylinder to put even amounts of potting mix and soil collect from Alex Fraser together in each pot. Anytime soil is being handled, I will wear gloves to avoid cross-contamination.

Experimental methods: 
Once seeds have germinated, I will weigh the seedlings for the initial biomass measurement. Once I have weighed the seedlings, I will put the seedlings into their pots for the rest of the experiment. This experiment has 16 treatments in total, and I will label each pot using ducktape and a sharpie with the respective treatment, replicate number, and species. I will keep track of where each pot is relative to others. I will separate each treatment based on species, temperature, and soil treatment (conspecific/heterospecific); for example, I will separate interior spruce and subalpine fir seedlings into different growth chambers. I will set two out of the four growth chambers to 10 degrees C. In contrast, I will set the other two growth chambers to 25 degrees C. I will keep soil types (conspecific/heterospecific) together; for example, heterospecific fir soil is the same as conspecific spruce soil thus, they can be present in the same growth chamber without cross-contamination. Within each growth chamber, I will separate sterilized soil from un-sterilized soil. The experiment will last six weeks; I will change each pot's placement halfway through the experiment.  I will water each pot every two days with the same amount of water measured using a graduated cylinder and deionized water. At the end of the experiment, I will reweigh each seedling to find out the final biomass.
