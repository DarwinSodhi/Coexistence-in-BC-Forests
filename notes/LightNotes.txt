Thery 2001. Forest light and its influence on habitat selection 

two types of light measurements: irradiance and radiance. Vaguely speaking, irradiance is the amount of light incoming to a certain point from possibly all directions, while radiance is the amount of light incoming to a point from a single directions.

Time of day effects light emitted as well as location compared to the equator 

different life scales of species may need different light intensities

This paper didn't have much about spectral diversity and focussed much more on tropical forests than temperate forests. 


Schmitt and Wulff TREE 1993

red to far red ratio of incidenct light may be dramatically reduced under a closed leaf canopy compared to ambient readings. Thius R:FR is an important cue by which plants may detect microenvironmental variation. 

changes due to crowding can be seen in R:FR not only in direct light but also when one competitior outshades another. These responses are phytochrome mediated. 

Box 1. describes phytochromes very well 

This paper dicusses red to far red ratio which can be used to infer competitive dynamics as well may show adapatation to environments.

researchers altered r:fr ratio to observe effect on a parasitic dodder on a plant. I am not sure how relevant this paper is to our work.

First paper to use this term spectral diversity which is a biodiversity metric based on spectra of electromagnetic radiation reflected from plants that integrates a range of functional differences among individuals and species. They tested not only spectral diversity but also phylogenetic and functional diversity. 

spectral dissimilarty explained 28% of distance in functional trait space and 20% of phylogenetic distance. 

Spectral diversity of plant communities explained 51% of total variation. 

paper explains how using spectral profiles of plants to estimate biodiversity is useful. 

Researchers used 400-2500nm. Figure 2 shows how maybe to grab full range of spectral diversity we may need better devices than we are using currently. 

Spectral diversity can capture variation that is not traditionally measured. 

Mehtods: only 2 tree species used, organized into functional groups sort of. 

They used a portable field spectrometer covering wavelengths of 340-2500, with a leaf clip. They collecte spectral data for 1m X 1m grid 4-8 times for a 9m x 9m plot. Spectral readings were taken at a leaf level.
